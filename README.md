# pyastro-tweets

The scripts in this repo were used to create the pages that provide
an overview of the tweets related to the "Python in Astronomy" meetings
that were held in 2015 and 2016.

Demo URL: http://python-in-astronomy.github.io/2015/twitter-archive.html

This repo does not contain the script that was used to collect the tweets
in realtime. That script lives in a separate repo at
https://github.com/barentsen/tweet-tracking
